# ðŸš†ðŸ“Š High speed services usage in Spain

## Overview
This project analyses data from a survey of the Spanish population and analyses the use of high speed as well as user preferences in terms of characteristics and operators. 

## Structure 
**Data collection**
Google forms is used and posted in different social media to understand usage of high-speed services as well as people's preferences.
Arrival times sample is taken at different train stations and days to compare real operational data. 

**Data cleaning**
Data is cleaned and clasified accordingly using python.

**Sample data representation**
Data is represented in different Tableau dashboards (using Tableau free version).

**Hipothesis testing**
1. Renfe is perceived as the most reliable company (Chi-Cuadrado / contingency table)
2. We can't say that Renfe is the most reliable company with arrival time. It can't said that is most reliable than any of the two other competitors (Iryo and Ouigo) (T-test).

**Future work**
1. Understand the influence of stops on reliability (Renfe has more stops where competation takes places).
2. Take real data and understand if Renfe-Avlo is competitive enough with current ticket options as Ouigo is perceived as the cheapest option.
